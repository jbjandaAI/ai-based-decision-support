# Web Application Plan: AI E-waste Decision Support System (VEIDD)
## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the plan for developing a web application based on the VEIDD (Visual recognition, Evaluation, Intactness, Difficulty, Decisioning) system described in the research paper "AI-based decision support system for enhancing end-of-life value recovery from e-wastes" by Simaei and Rahimifard (2024). The web application will serve as the primary interface for users to interact with the VEIDD system, manage e-waste data, initiate the decision process, and view the recommended End-of-Life (EoL) treatment paths.
## 2. Goals & Objectives
Primary Goal: To create a user-friendly, efficient, and scalable web application that implements the core logic of the VEIDD decision support system.
Objectives:
Provide an interface for initiating the analysis of incoming e-waste items (simulated or via integrated hardware).
Integrate with the AI visual recognition component to identify e-waste products.
Implement the multi-criteria analysis (Evaluation, Intactness, Difficulty) based on the paper's methodology.
Implement the fuzzy logic decision engine to determine the optimal EoL path.
Provide a robust database management system for e-waste product attributes.
Display clear and actionable results and recommendations to the user.
Offer reporting and potentially configuration options.
## 3. Target Audience
Recycling Facility Operators/Technicians: Users responsible for processing e-waste and following the system's recommendations.
System Administrators: Users responsible for managing the database, user accounts, and system configuration.
Researchers/Managers: Users interested in analyzing processing data, system performance, and trends.
## 4. Core VEIDD Workflow Integration
The web application will facilitate the following workflow derived from the paper:
Input: Receive e-waste item data (e.g., image(s) from cameras/upload, weight measurement).
Visual Recognition: Send image data to the AI visual recognition module and receive classification results (product type/model, confidence score).
Database Lookup: Retrieve nominal weight, initial price, manufacturing year, dimensions, shell material, etc., for the identified product from the e-waste database.
Analysis & Calculation:
Evaluation Estimation: Calculate value based on initial price and manufacturing year using fuzzy logic rules (Figure 10).
Intactness Analysis: Calculate the Weight Ratio (WR) based on measured vs. nominal weight (Figure 11).
Difficulty Assessment: Calculate Overall Density (OD) and use it along with Shell Material (SM) to determine process difficulty using fuzzy logic rules (Table 1, Figure 12).
Fuzzy Decisioning: Input the results from Evaluation, Intactness, and Difficulty into the final fuzzy decision engine (Figure 13, Table 2).
Output: Display the final recommended EoL operation path (e.g., Manual Disassembly, Robotic Disassembly, Robotic Extraction, Shredding) to the user.
## 5. Proposed Web Application Architecture
A standard multi-tier web application architecture is proposed:
Frontend (Client-side): User Interface built with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular). Handles user interaction, data display, and communication with the backend.
Backend (Server-side): API server built with a robust framework (e.g., Python with Flask/Django, Node.js with Express). Handles business logic, database interactions, user authentication, and communication with the AI model and potentially hardware interfaces.
Database: Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) database to store:
E-waste product catalog (attributes like model, nominal weight, price category, year category, dimensions, shell material, etc.).
Processing logs (details of each item processed, inputs, intermediate results, final decision).
User accounts and permissions.
AI Visual Recognition Module: The trained AI model (e.g., based on AlexNet or a more modern CNN). This could be hosted as a separate microservice with its own API, which the backend interacts with.
(Optional) Hardware Integration Layer: An interface (e.g., via specific APIs or protocols like MQTT) to communicate with physical systems like cameras, scales, and conveyor belts if direct integration is desired.
## 6. Key Features & Modules
Dashboard:
Overview of system status.
Summary statistics (e.g., items processed today, EoL path distribution).
Quick access to key functions.
E-waste Processing Module:
Interface to initiate processing for a new item.
Mechanism to input/receive image data (upload or camera feed integration).
Mechanism to input/receive weight data (manual entry or scale integration).
Real-time display of visual recognition results.
Step-by-step visualization of the VEIDD analysis (Evaluation, Intactness, Difficulty scores).
Clear display of the final recommended EoL path.
Option to log or confirm the processing outcome.
E-waste Database Management Module (Admin Interface):
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for product categories and models.
Interface similar to Figure 9 for adding/editing product attributes (nominal weight, battery weight, initial price category, year manufactured category, dimensions, shell material).
Bulk import/export capabilities (optional).
Search and filtering functionality.
Reporting & Analytics Module:
View historical processing logs.
Generate reports on processing volumes, EoL path distributions over time, etc.
Visualize data using charts and graphs.
User Management Module (Admin Interface):
Add, edit, and remove user accounts.
Assign user roles and permissions.
Configuration Module (Admin Interface - Optional):
Adjust system parameters (e.g., confidence thresholds for recognition).
Potentially view or manage fuzzy logic rules (for advanced users).
## 7. Technology Stack (Suggestions)
Frontend: React, Vue.js, or Angular; Tailwind CSS or similar UI library.
Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express).
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
AI Model: TensorFlow, PyTorch (served via TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, or a custom API).
Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Platform (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
## 8. Development Phases (High-Level)
Planning & Design: Refine requirements, create detailed UI/UX mockups, finalize architecture and technology stack.
Backend Development: Set up database schema, build API endpoints, implement core VEIDD logic (Evaluation, Intactness, Difficulty, Fuzzy Decisioning), set up user authentication.
AI Model Integration: Develop the interface/API for communication between the backend and the visual recognition model. Ensure the model is trained and deployable.
Frontend Development: Build the user interface components based on mockups, integrate with backend APIs.
Integration & Testing: Integrate all components, perform thorough unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Test with diverse e-waste examples.
Deployment: Deploy the application and AI model to a staging/production environment.
Maintenance & Iteration: Ongoing monitoring, bug fixing, and potential feature enhancements based on user feedback.
## 9. Future Enhancements (Based on Paper)
Integration with more advanced recognition techniques (e.g., fluoroscopy imaging for internal assessment).
Integration with robotic control systems for automated execution of recommended EoL paths.
Incorporation of cost-benefit analysis for each EoL operation path.
Continuous learning capabilities for the AI model based on operator feedback or new data.
## 10. Assumptions & Dependencies
A trained and deployable AI visual recognition model is available or will be developed concurrently.
Access to necessary e-waste product data (datasheets, online sources, or manual input) for populating the database.
Availability of hardware (cameras, scales) if direct integration is required.
This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing the VEIDD web application, translating the research concepts into a functional software system.
